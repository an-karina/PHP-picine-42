# PHP-picine-42
PHP Pool is a project for those who wants to learn PHP (as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL) form the very beginning. It consists of 10 daily projects (each of them may include up to 20 small tasks) and 2 global projects - rushes (they offer you to create an online-shop and browser game respectively).

All pdf-files with tasks are in the appropriate folders (check files named dxx.en.pdf where xx is the number of day starting with 00).

# Specific notes for the days
Check out Day 05 for a bunch of mysql queries, Day 07 - for OOP in PHP, Day 09 - for JavaScript. Day 08 and Rush 01 are, in fact, has the same task: create a browser game. In this repository there is only template for the game and some non-game features like top-players rating, authorization form, etc.

# How to run
Some of the days contain .php files that could be launched in your shell. Other ones require a local server like MAMP to be evaluated. Make sure that you have all the stuff (including MySQL and Apache) launching and working correctly.
